Dark mode support for Canvas. Stay up late doing your homework, without the eyestrain.
## About
Annoyed that Canvas doesn't support dark mode? Then this extension is for you! Now you can procrastinate on your assignments all night long, without straining your eyes!

This web extension adds a dark mode for the Canvas website! This can be useful at night, for those who have vision impairment, or for people who just prefer dark mode to light mode.  

The extension works for most organizations that use Canvas. If yours isn't supported, don't be afraid to reach out!

If you're a UNC Charlotte student, you have additional perks! The extension also adds dark mode to the following sites used by UNCC students:
* WebWork
* UNCC WebAuth login Pages
* And more to come!

While the extension's main priority will always be to bring dark mode to Canvas, I plan to add dark mode for other websites frequently used by students in the future.
