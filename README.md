Dark mode support for Canvas. Stay up late doing your homework, without the eyestrain.
## About
Annoyed that Canvas doesn't support dark mode? Then this extension is for you! Now you can procrastinate on your assignments all night long, without straining your eyes!

This extension modifies all Canvas Instructure URLs in order to add dark mode support.  It works for all organizations that use Canvas. This can be useful at night, for those who have vision impairment, or for people who just prefer dark mode to light mode.  

--

Dark Mode for Canvas is not affiliated with Canvas and is an unofficial extension that injects custom CSS when the site is loaded in order to provide a dark theme.
