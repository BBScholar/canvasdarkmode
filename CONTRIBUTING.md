## Contributing Guidelines
### Development Process
1) The extension is primarily developed for Chromium-based browsers. Please use a browser such as Chrome, Brave, Edge, Yandex, or Iridium to develop the extension. The code for the Chromium build lives in the master branch of this repository.

2) I won't accept pull requests for the Firefox build that lives in the firefox-edition branch. Only pull requests for the master branch are allowed. Once the pull request is accepted from there, it will be converted over to the firefox-edition branch.

3) When making modifications to the popup/browser action window or any other user-viewable aspect of the extension, try to following the styling already laid out in these areas. If you have a brand new style you would like to contribute, that is also acceptable.

4) Any other questions regarding development can go to canvasdarkmode@rousseau.page
