## Contributing Guidelines
I am completely open to any and all ideas that someone may have for Dark Mode for Canvas.

If there's a cool feature or idea that you think the extension can use, feel free to contribute. 

I don't have specific guidelines for contributing, just open a pull request and if it looks good I'll merge it with the master branch!
